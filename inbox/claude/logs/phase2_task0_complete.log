Task Source: GPT-5.1

TASK DESCRIPTION:
-----------------
Fix template-loader behavior in 3 steps:
1. Add missing event listener for template loading
2. Make template selector visible again
3. Prevent loadDesign() from wiping out template ID

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
1. /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/index.html
   - Fixed event listener to use correct element ID
   - Changed "template-select" to "template-selector"

2. /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/css/builder.css
   - Added CSS rules to force template selector visibility
   - Applied !important flags to ensure visibility

3. /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/js/app-save-load.js
   - Added safe template restoration in loadProjectFromComputer()
   - Added safe template restoration in loadProject()
   - Added safe template restoration in loadDesignFromCard()

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
-----------------------
Step 1: Fixed Event Listener
- Identified mismatch between HTML element ID and JavaScript selector
- HTML has id="template-selector" but JS was looking for "template-select"
- Corrected JavaScript to use "template-selector"

Step 2: CSS Visibility Fix
- Added CSS rules to builder.css to force visibility
- Applied to multiple selector variations for safety
- Used !important to override any conflicting styles

Step 3: Safe Template Restoration
- Added validation checks before setting template
- Ensures template exists in templates object
- Provides console warnings and user alerts for missing templates
- Prevents corruption of current template if load fails

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
------------------------
1. Test loading a saved design with valid template
2. Test loading a saved design with invalid/missing template
3. Verify template selector appears and responds to changes
4. Confirm template selection persists through save/load cycles

STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
-------------------------------
All three steps of the task have been implemented as specified.
