Task: Fix Templates dropdown disappearing bug

PROBLEM:
--------
When hovering "Templates" in the top navigation, the dropdown would close when moving the cursor down from the label to the menu. This was caused by a 10px gap (margin-top) between the nav item and the dropdown, creating a dead zone that lost the hover state.

SOLUTION PROVIDED BY GPT-5.1:
-----------------------------
GPT-5.1 analyzed the issue and provided implementation guidance:
1. Ensure HTML structure wraps trigger + dropdown in one parent (✓ already correct)
2. Eliminate vertical gap by setting margin-top to 0 or negative value
3. Ensure hover/focus logic applies to parent container (✓ already correct in JS)

IMPLEMENTATION:
--------------
File Modified: /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/css/masthead.css

Changed line 104 in .templates-dropdown rule:
FROM: margin-top: 10px; /* Gap between underline and dropdown */
TO:   margin-top: -2px; /* Slight overlap to eliminate any pixel seam */

REASONING:
- -2px creates a tiny overlap, ensuring no pixel seam can form
- Dropdown now sits flush with (and slightly overlaps) the nav item
- Combined with existing GSAP hover logic on parent container, this creates seamless interaction

VERIFICATION:
------------
- Chrome opened with file:///Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/index.html
- Ready for user testing of hover behavior

ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT:
-------------------
None. This is a pure CSS fix that doesn't affect:
- HTML structure (already correct)
- JavaScript logic (already correct)
- Data contracts or templates

TOOLS USED:
----------
✓ Filesystem:read_text_file (to read current CSS)
✓ Filesystem:write_file (to write updated CSS)
✓ Control Chrome:open_url (to test changes)
