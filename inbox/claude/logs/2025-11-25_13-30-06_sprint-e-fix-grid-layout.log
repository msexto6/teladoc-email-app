SPRINT E FIX - FEATURED CONTENT GRID LAYOUT
============================================
Date: 2025-11-25 13:30:06
Issue: Featured content cards displaying vertically instead of side-by-side
Fixed by: Claude (MCP)

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
------------------
Standard Template was using INCORRECT CSS class names for the featured content section:
- Used: preview-featured-section (wrong)
- Used: preview-section-title (wrong)
- Used: preview-feature-grid (wrong)

This caused the featured content cards to stack vertically instead of displaying
in a 2-column side-by-side grid like Education Drip - HP.

SOLUTION
--------
Updated js/templates/standard-template.js to use the CORRECT CSS classes
that match Education Drip - HP:
- Changed to: preview-speakers-section (correct)
- Changed to: preview-speakers-title (correct)
- Changed to: preview-features-grid (correct)

FILE MODIFIED
-------------
js/templates/standard-template.js - Lines 73-79

CHANGES MADE
------------
Line 73: <div class="preview-featured-section"> 
      → <div class="preview-speakers-section">

Line 74: <h3 class="preview-section-title">
      → <h3 class="preview-speakers-title">

Line 75: <div class="preview-feature-grid">
      → <div class="preview-features-grid">

EXPECTED RESULT
---------------
✅ Featured content cards now display side-by-side in 2-column grid
✅ Layout matches Education Drip - HP template
✅ Cards have proper white background boxes with padding
✅ Responsive and professional appearance

TEST IN BROWSER
---------------
1. Reload the app (CMD+R)
2. Select Standard Template
3. Verify featured content shows in 2-column grid (not stacked vertically)
4. Should match the Education Drip - HP layout style
