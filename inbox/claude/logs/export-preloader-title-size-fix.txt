EXPORT PRELOADER TITLE SIZE FIX
================================

Date: Sunday, November 30, 2025
Issue: "Building your export package…" text wrapping
Status: FIXED ✅

PROBLEM
-------
The export preloader title "Building your export package…" was wrapping to two lines because the text was too long for the modal width at 24px font size.

SOLUTION
--------
Reduced the font size by 20% specifically for the export overlay title:
- Original: 24px
- New: 19.2px (24 * 0.8)

This keeps the text on a single line without affecting other modal titles.

CHANGE MADE
-----------
File: css/modals.css
Location: After .export-overlay-state declaration

Added:
```css
/* Export Overlay Title - 20% smaller to prevent wrapping */
.export-overlay-state .modal-title {
    font-size: 19.2px;
}
```

SPECIFICITY
-----------
This rule specifically targets modal titles inside .export-overlay-state, so:
✅ Export preloader: 19.2px (smaller, no wrap)
✅ Export success modal: 19.2px (smaller, no wrap)  
✅ All other modals: 24px (unchanged)

The selector `.export-overlay-state .modal-title` has higher specificity than just `.modal-title`, so it overrides the default size only for export overlays.

VISUAL RESULT
-------------
"Building your export package…" now displays on a single line with proper spacing and maintains the Effra Bold font family.
