EXPORT MODAL SIMPLIFICATION – IMPLEMENTATION LOG
================================================
Date: 2025-11-23
Task: Remove folder selection UI from Export modal and implement auto-folder assignment

CHANGES MADE:

1. HTML (index.html) - Export Modal
   ✅ Modal body already simplified with ZIP contents description
   ✅ Folder selection UI already removed from markup
   ✅ Typography already matches spec:
      - "Your ZIP file will contain:" → 16px, font-weight: 600
      - Bullet items → 14px standard body text
      - "Saved to..." line → 14px standard body text

2. Firebase Module (js/app-firebase.js) - saveExportMetadata()
   ✅ Updated function to auto-determine folder from source design
   ✅ Logic flow:
      - If designId provided → fetch source design from Firestore
      - If source design has folderId → use that folder
      - If no folder or no design → default to null (My Designs root)
   ✅ Added folderId field to export metadata document
   ✅ Enhanced logging to show folder inheritance

3. Export Logic (js/app-export.js)
   ✅ Already calls saveExportMetadata() correctly
   ✅ Passes designId from window.currentLocalStorageKey
   ✅ No changes needed - function will automatically pick up folder

BEHAVIOR:
- Export modal shows only ZIP description + buttons
- No folder selection UI visible
- Behind the scenes: export metadata inherits folder from source design
- If design is in "Q4 Campaign" folder → export logged to "Q4 Campaign"
- If design is in root → export logged to "My Designs" (null folder)
- Admin Export History panel will correctly filter by folder

TESTING CHECKLIST:
☐ Open Export modal → see only ZIP description, no folder UI
☐ Export a design from root → check Admin panel shows folderId: null
☐ Export a design from a folder → check Admin panel shows correct folderId
☐ Verify exported files still download correctly
☐ Verify Admin panel folder filtering still works

AFFECTED FILES:
- /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/index.html (no changes - already correct)
- /Users/marksexton/Desktop/Email-Briefing-App/js/app-firebase.js (updated saveExportMetadata)

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for testing
