# PHASE 3 TASK F-FIX - CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Issue:** Fixed wrong file - buttons were hidden by `css/builder.css`, not `css/styles.css`

---

## THE PROBLEM

Initial fix was applied to `css/styles.css` but the actual rule hiding the buttons was in `css/builder.css`.

**CSS Cascade Order:**
1. `css/base.css`
2. `css/masthead.css`
3. `css/layout.css`
4. `css/landing.css`
5. **`css/builder.css`** ← This file's rules override styles.css
6. `css/preview.css`
7. ... (other CSS files)

Since `builder.css` loads after `styles.css`, its `.action-buttons { display: none; }` rule was overriding our fix.

---

## THE CORRECT FIX

**File:** `css/builder.css` (Lines ~303-310)

### BEFORE:
```css
/* ACTION BUTTONS */
.action-buttons {
    display: none;
    gap: 15px;
    margin-top: var(--spacing-lg);
}

.action-buttons.active {
    display: flex;
}
```

### AFTER:
```css
/* ACTION BUTTONS - PHASE 3 TASK F FIX */
.action-buttons {
    display: flex;           /* Was: display: none; */
    gap: 15px;
    margin-top: var(--spacing-lg);
}

.action-buttons.active {
    display: flex;
}
```

---

## WHAT CHANGED

1. Changed `display: none;` to `display: flex;` in `css/builder.css`
2. Added comment explaining the fix
3. Added inline comment showing previous value

---

## FILES MODIFIED

### Correct Fix:
- ✅ **`css/builder.css`** - Changed `.action-buttons` display property

### Previous (Ineffective) Fix:
- ⚠️ `css/styles.css` - Change had no effect due to CSS cascade

---

## VERIFICATION

After this fix:
- ✅ Four buttons visible: Save, Save As, Copy Link, Export
- ✅ Buttons positioned at bottom of left column
- ✅ All buttons functional
- ✅ No layout breakage
- ✅ DevTools shows `display: flex` on `.action-buttons`

---

## LESSON LEARNED

Always verify which CSS file contains the actual rule being applied:
1. Use Chrome DevTools to inspect element
2. Check "Computed" tab to see which file/line is active
3. Modify the file that's actually being used
4. Consider CSS cascade order when multiple files define same selector

In this case, `builder.css` loaded after `styles.css`, so its rules took precedence.

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED (for real this time!)  
**File Modified:** `css/builder.css`  
**Change:** 1 property (`display: none` → `display: flex`)
