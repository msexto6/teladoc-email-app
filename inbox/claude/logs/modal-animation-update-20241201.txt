================================================
Timestamp: 2024-12-01
Engineer: Claude MCP
Status: ✓ Complete

TASK SUMMARY:
Update modal dialog animations to use scale-only motion without vertical sliding.

FILES MODIFIED:
- js/ui-animations.js

CHANGES:
1. animateModalOpen(): Changed scale from 0.97 → 0.80, removed y: 16 movement
2. animateModalClose(): Changed scale from 0.97 → 0.80, removed y: 10 movement

RESULT:
All modals now use centered scale animation (0.80 ↔ 1.00) with no vertical motion.
Overlay fade animations preserved.

TESTING REQUIRED:
- Open any modal (Save, Load, New Design, Settings)
- Verify smooth scale-only animation
- Verify no vertical sliding
- Verify proper fade behavior

Next: Test in browser by opening modals.
